        Welcome to the maiden issue of the Journal of Industrial and Organisational Behavior in
Africa (JIOBA). The journey towards the publication of the journal started during the Annual
Conference of the Nigerian Psychological Association (NPA) held on November 2016 at the
Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. During the conference the Industrial and Organisational
Psychology division of NPA held a meeting of the division and resolved to have an active
umbrella association for all industrial and organisational psychologists in Nigeria. In the
meeting a new association named Nigerian Association of Industrial and Organisational
Psychologists (NAIOP) was formally established. The excitement that surrounded the
formation of the new association led to the hosting of the NAIOP annual conferences at the
University of Ibadan in 2017 and Benue State University, Makurdi in 2018. The success
recorded from these two conferences led to the desire to establish a flagship journal for the
NAIOP.
        </p>

             <p class="mb-5">
       We are happy to celebrate the birth of the Journal of Industrial and Organisational Behavior
in Africa. It is a dream come true. The JIOBA though is in its infancy stage, our desire is to
attract and publish high quality articles from leading scholars in the field of industrial and
organisational psychology in Africa and from other parts of the world. We have deliberate
plan to increase the quality of articles in the volumes by recruiting distinguished scholars in
reputable institutions across the world to serve as reviewers and editors of the journal. We are
optimistic about the contributions of the journal to the global discussions on industrial and
organisational psychology.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">Deserving special thanks for their contributions to the success of the birth of this journal and
this maiden issue are the executive council and members of the NAIOP for approving that
JIOBA be established as the main platform for communicating issues relating to industrial
and organisational psychology in Nigeria. I wish also to thank the editorial team for ensuring
that this maiden issue is published despite some of the challenges we encountered at the early
stages of the establishment of the journal. We thank the reviewers of the articles published in
this issue for their selfless service to humanity. In a special way, we thank the contributors to
this volume for their resilience and accepting to go through with us the long review period.
The journey has just started. As we look forward to seeing the JIOBA as a major voice in the
field we hope that research published through the journal will continue to shape the science
and practice of industrial and organisational psychology in Africa and beyond.</p>
